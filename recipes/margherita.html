            <h3>For The Topping:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 bunch fresh basil leaves</li>

                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <h3>1. Make the Dough:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Mix until the dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>2. Prepare the Sauce:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the canned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes until it thickens slightly.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt, pepper, and oregano (if using). You can add a teaspoon of sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Let the sauce cool.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>3. Assemble the Pizza:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, usually around 500°F (260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions (or keep it whole for one large pizza). Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
                <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a piece of parchment paper if you're using a pizza stone, or on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Arrange the mozzarella slices evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>4. Finishing Touches</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately scatter fresh basil leaves over the top.</li>
                <li>Drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
