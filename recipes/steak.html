                    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                    <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For the Garlic Butter Sauce:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
                    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <h3>1. Prepare the Steaks:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30-60 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature. Pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Generously season both sides of the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
              </ol>
            <h3>2. Make the Garlic Butter Sauce:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, fresh parsley, lemon juice (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>3. Cook the Steaks:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over high heat until it is very hot.</li>
                    <li>Add the olive oil to the skillet. When the oil is shimmering and hot, add the steaks. Sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until a nice crust forms.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the 2 tablespoons of butter, smashed garlic cloves, and rosemary or thyme sprigs to the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Tilt the skillet slightly and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter and garlic-herb mixture. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until the steaks reach your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature: 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, 140°F (60°C) for medium.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>4. Rest the Steaks:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Transfer the steaks to a plate and let them rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and results in a more flavorful and tender steak.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>5. Serve:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Top each steak with a generous dollop of the garlic butter sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, accompanied by your favorite sides such as mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Enjoy your steak!</h2>
